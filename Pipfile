# If `editable` is set to `false`, pipenv gives a warning saying that in newer versions of pip
# local packages will be built in-place without first copying to a temporary directory.
# This is an equivalent of `editable=true`, so having `editable=true` not only is convenient
# but also conforms with newer pip regulations.
